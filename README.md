An initial workshop was outlined at the first hackathon.

[Reproducible Research using Jupyter Notebooks:Workshop Overview](https://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/rr-jupyter-workshop/)

In this hackathon, we'll work towards getting individual lessons to a state where they can be taught and have a 1.0 beta release of the lessons. The hackathon will be followed by teaching this curriculum at UC Merced January 11-12, 2018.

## Draft Agenda

**Before the meeting:** Participants provided an overview of the lessons, and participants decide which lesson they
